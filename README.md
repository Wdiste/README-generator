  ## Description
  
  This project will be used to not only learn about node.js, but also to create a powerful tool for future use.  As a student, all my projects require a README file and with this application, I will be able to create good quality README's with minimum effort.
  
  ## Installation
  
  To install, simply visit Github via the link in this readme and download the code there.

  ## Usage

  To use this generator, run the code in VS Code using the 'node ./Develop/index.js command and follow the user prompts to build your own README!
  
  ## Contributing
  
  At the moment this project does not require nor accept contributions, as it is a homework assignment.

  ## Tests

  To test this application, simply run the code as instructed and a new file ('README.md') should be created.  Open this file to verify all input has been recorded properly.

  Follow the link for a demo of how to run code:

  ```
  Selecting a license from the list in inquirer provides the license section as shown in the demo but selecting the "no license" option will render a readme without 
  a license section at all:
